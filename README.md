Create Read Update and Delete framework using JS

## Tasks

- [ ] Where to store data? (localstorage)
- [ ] How to capture data? (web form)
- [ ] How to modify data? (update action, delete action)
- [ ] How to view data? (style?)
- [ ] UI/UX considerations (how are we going to use this?)

### Advanced Reqs
- [ ] Clear inputs on click of 'add' button
- [ ] Make 'add' generate unique key (id) for each entry and get rid of the 'key' input on the form
- [ ] Add function should ouput to display: entry data (ToDo item) with unique edit and delete buttons
- [ ] Rearrange UI
- [ ] Clear button: should be obvious that Clear means to clear all ToDos and maybe say 'Clear all'

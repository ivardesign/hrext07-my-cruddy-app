# Hack Reactor: hrext07-my-cruddy-app
Create Read Update and Delete framework using JS

## Sortable ToDo List

## Intro:

This app depends on jQuery, jQueryUI and JavaScript.  The starting HTML and app direction began with the 'my-cruddy-app-1' at HREXT07. 

All other work here is original and evolved to include responsive architecture and CSS with additional app function.  

It uses only localStorage for memory and can work on a page with other systems that share use of localStorage.

ToDo items can be sorted (drag and drop).

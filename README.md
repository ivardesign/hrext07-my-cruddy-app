Create Read Update and Delete framework using JS

## Tasks

- [ ] Where to store data? (localstorage)
- [ ] How to capture data? (web form)
- [ ] How to modify data? (update action, delete action)
- [ ] How to view data? (style?)
- [ ] UI/UX considerations (how are we going to use this?)

### Advanced Reqs
- [ ] Clear inputs on click of 'add' button
- [ ] Make 'add' generate unique key (id) for each entry and get rid of the 'key' input on the form
- [ ] Add function should ouput to display: entry data (ToDo item) with unique edit and delete buttons
- [ ] Rearrange UI
- [ ] Clear button: should be obvious that Clear means to clear all ToDos and maybe say 'Clear all'

This app is not meant to be practical. It is simply an exercise in basic use of localstorage and elementary JS/JQuery.
